-- PURPOSE: Sales Analytics Module - Complete sales performance tracking
-- AUTHOR: SQL Bootcamp
-- CREATED: 2025
--
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   This is the heart of retail analytics. Every Monday morning at Flipkart,
--   Amazon, or BigBasket, leadership asks: "How did we do last week?"
--   
--   This module answers:
--   - How much revenue did we generate? (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly)
--   - Are we growing or declining? (MoM, QoQ, YoY comparisons)
--   - What payment methods do customers prefer?
--   - Weekend vs Weekday performance?
--   - What are the trends? (Moving averages)
--
-- CREATES:
--   • 8 Regular Views
--   • 2 Materialized Views  
--   • 8 JSON Export Functions

-- EXECUTION ORDER: Run AFTER 02_data_quality scripts
